    "PItBE (Popularized Implementation for the BE) is a Python package designed to implement the BE method on quantum circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "This package enables BE-based implementations for arbitrary non-unitary matrices, as long as they can be expressed as linear combinations of unitary (Pauli-product) matrices. This is achieved through internal functions that calculate the required matrices acting on ancillary qubits and assign the corresponding control bits and controlled quantum gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "While executing a BE procedure requires combining multiple functions from the package, the process closely follows the formal steps of the BE method.\\\n",
    "As a result, users with prior knowledge of BE can easily use the package, and even beginners can deepen their understanding of BE theory by running and experimenting with this implementation."
