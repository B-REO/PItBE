    "Quantum computers are based on qubits, which differ fundamentally from classical bits used in conventional computing systems. By harnessing quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, quantum algorithms have the potential to perform certain computations and data processing tasks that are infeasible for classical computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, quantum circuits are subject to several physical and mathematical constraints. One major limitation is that only unitary operations are allowed within quantum circuits. As a result, directly applying non-unitary matrices—which often arise in chemistry and physics simulations (e.g., dissipative dynamics, measurement processes)—is not straightforward. This makes tasks such as computing expectation values or simulating non-unitary transformations challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module implements a solution to that problem using a technique called Block-Encoding (BE) [1]. The BE framework allows a non-unitary matrix to be embedded within a larger unitary operator, provided the matrix can be decomposed into a linear combination of production of Pauli matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the algorithm constructs a unitary circuit that applies each Pauli term conditionally via ancillary (control) qubits. This allows the effective application of the non-unitary matrix to a quantum state within the constraints of unitary-only quantum hardware.\n",
