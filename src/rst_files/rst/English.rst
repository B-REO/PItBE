=====================================

The module PItBE is designed for executing 
the Block-Encoding (BE) method with ease.
It allows users to implement BE-based procedures 
simply and efficiently.
To promote broader adoption of the BE method, 
this module also includes explanatory text covering its theoretical background.

This document is composed of the following sections:
* Block-Encoding: Theoretical explanation of the Block-Encoding method
* PItBE: Overview of this module and recommended execution environment
* Contents: Individual pages explaining each function included in this module
* Demo: Practical example demonstrating the use of this module to implement the Block-Encoding method
