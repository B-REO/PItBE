# PItBE
## Introduction

This Python package implements the Block-Encoding (BE) method, which allows for simulating non-unitary operators on a quantum circuit, assuming that the Hamiltonian can be expressed as a linear combination of Pauli products.

The program is designed to work in conjunction with the following quantum software frameworks:

- [OpenFermion](https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion): A library for quantum chemistry simulations on quantum computers.  
- [Qulacs](https://github.com/qulacs/qulacs) (recommended): A high-speed quantum circuit simulator optimized for performance.  
- [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit): IBM's open-source quantum computing framework.

To use this package effectively, we **strongly recommend** installing one of the above platforms—preferably **Qulacs**.

Some parts of this package were developed with reference to the behavior and outputs of [PennyLane](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane), a quantum machine learning library developed by **Xanadu**.

If you prefer the Japanese version, please refer to [this page](src/rst_files/read_me_jp.md).


## How to use
We recommend using this package by either:

- cloning the entire `PItBE` folder, or  
- cloning only the `pitbe` subfolder inside the `src` directory from the GitHub repository to your local machine.

The theoretical background of the Block-Encoding method, as well as documentation for the functions included in `pitbe`, is available on the package’s [GitHub Pages](https://b-reo.github.io/PItBE/). We highly recommend reading through this documentation before use.

You can also refer to the Jupyter notebooks in the `src/rst_files` directory. Each notebook is named after a corresponding function in `pitbe`, making it easy to find example usages and explanations.

As a practical example of how to use the package, the [GitHub Pages](https://b-reo.github.io/PItBE/) site includes a section titled **Demo Play**, which we also recommend reviewing.

> **Note:** Files and folders other than `pitbe` and `src` in this repository are not necessary for running the program and can be safely ignored.

## Finally
This program is still in an early and experimental stage, and we acknowledge that it is far from being user-friendly or polished.  
However, this also indicates its potential for further development and improvement.  
We hope you will look forward to future updates.
